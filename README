MetaBase (http://MetaDatabase.Org) was started in 2007 to serve as:

    "... a user-contributed list of all the biological databases
     available on the internet."


As the number and quality of resources available continues to grow,
this is seen as a vital objective.

MetaBase has been implemented as a MediaWiki [1] instance, and uses
Semantic MediaWiki [2] to organize data.

This repo holds the code used to programmatically administer the wiki,
and specifically to synchronize the content with the annual Nucleic
Acids Research Database Issue (online Molecular Biology Database
Collection) [3].
